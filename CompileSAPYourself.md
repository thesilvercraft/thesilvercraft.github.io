grab the sources from github by:
`git clone https://github.com/thesilvercraft/SilverAudioPlayer.git`  
And compile it yourself (that's why open source is good)  
`dotnet build`
Before compiling it yourself consider editing `SilverAudioPlayer.Avalonia.csproj`  

if you like unstable gui build apps try launching `GUIBuild.bat` or `GUIBuild.sh`
